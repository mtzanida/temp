# Project Template

This repository serves as a template for quickly starting new projects with essential configurations and file structures.

## Getting Started

To create a new repository based on this template, click the **"Use this template"** button at the top of this page. This will generate a new repository containing all the files and settings included here.

### Features Included

- **Custom Labels**: Predefined labels for issues and pull requests.
- **Code Owners**: The initial creator of the repository will automatically be set as the code owner.
- **Secrets Management**: A dummy secrets YAML file is included for managing sensitive data.

### Steps to Use

1. **Create a New Repository**: Click the **"Use this template"** button to generate your new repository.
2. **Clone Your Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/<new_repo_name>.git

# Managing Secrets with SOPS

This document outlines the steps to manage secrets in your project using [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops). SOPS is a tool for managing encrypted files, which helps keep sensitive data safe.

3. [Creating and Encrypting Secrets](#creating-and-encrypting-secrets)
4. [Decrypting Secrets](#decrypting-secrets)
5. [Security Best Practices](#security-best-practices)

## Installation

### macOS

You can install `sops` using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install sops
```
````

### Windows

For Windows, use Chocolatey:

```bash
choco install sops
```

### Linux

Download the binary from the [sops GitHub releases](https://github.com/mozilla/sops/releases).

## Creating a GPG Key (Optional)

If you donâ€™t already have a GPG key, you can create one with the following command:

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

Follow the prompts to generate your key.

## Creating and Encrypting Secrets

1. **Create the `secrets.yaml` file**:

   Create a `secrets.yaml` file with the sensitive information:

   ```yaml
   # secrets.yaml
   api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
   db_password: "YOUR_DB_PASSWORD_HERE"
   ```

2. **Encrypt the `secrets.yaml` file**:

   Run the following command to encrypt your secrets file. Replace `your_gpg_key_id` with your actual GPG key ID:

   ```bash
   sops --encrypt --gpg your_gpg_key_id secrets.yaml > secrets.enc.yaml
   ```

   This will create an encrypted file called `secrets.enc.yaml`. It's advisable to delete the original `secrets.yaml` file to avoid exposing sensitive information.

## Decrypting Secrets

You can decrypt the `secrets.enc.yaml` file when you need to access your secrets.

### Example in Python

1. **Install the `PyYAML` library**:

   ```bash
   pip install pyyaml
   ```

2. **Load and decrypt the secrets in your code**:

   ```python
   import subprocess
   import yaml

   # Decrypt the secrets file using sops
   decrypted_yaml = subprocess.check_output(['sops', '-d', 'secrets.enc.yaml'])

   # Load the decrypted secrets
   secrets = yaml.safe_load(decrypted_yaml)

   # Access your secrets
   api_key = secrets['api_key']
   db_password = secrets['db_password']

   print(f"API Key: {api_key}")
   ```

### Example in Node.js

1. **Install the `js-yaml` package**:

   ```bash
   npm install js-yaml
   ```

2. **Load and decrypt the secrets in your code**:

   ```javascript
   const fs = require("fs");
   const yaml = require("js-yaml");
   const { execSync } = require("child_process");

   // Decrypt the secrets file using sops
   const decryptedYaml = execSync("sops -d secrets.enc.yaml").toString();

   // Load the decrypted secrets
   const secrets = yaml.load(decryptedYaml);
   const apiKey = secrets.api_key;
   const dbPassword = secrets.db_password;

   console.log(`API Key: ${apiKey}`);
   ```

## Security Best Practices

- **Git Ignore**: Make sure to add `secrets.yaml` and `secrets.enc.yaml` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent them from being committed to your repository:

  ```gitignore
  # Ignore the plain secrets file
  secrets.yaml
  # Ignore the encrypted secrets file if not needed in repo
  secrets.enc.yaml
  ```

- **Access Control**: Ensure that your GPG key is secured and that only authorized personnel have access to it. This is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality of your secrets.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively manage your secrets in your project using `sops`. Always handle sensitive information carefully, leveraging encryption and proper access control to protect your secrets.
